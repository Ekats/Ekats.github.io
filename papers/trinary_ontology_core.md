# Trinary Discrete Ontology

## The Idea

Reality consists of three states:

| State | Value | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Existence | +1 | Something is here |
| Neutral | 0 | Nothing asked |
| Absence | -1 | Nothing is here |

Both +1 and -1 deviate from neutral. Both deviations create what we call gravity.

**Black holes are -1** — regions of absence, not infinitely compressed presence. The "mass" we measure is the steepness of the boundary between 0 (space) and -1 (absence). We're measuring the slope of the drain, not contents in it.

**Why this isn't obviously wrong:** Mass = gradient magnitude at boundary. And |+1 - 0| = |-1 - 0|. Both states deviate from neutral by exactly the same amount. When a star collapses, the gradient magnitude is naturally preserved — what changes is interior state, not boundary steepness. Mass is automatically conserved because the math is symmetric.

## Why Three States?

Binary (existence/non-existence) can't distinguish between "nothing here" and "no question asked." Space isn't empty matter-container. Space is the neutral canvas that makes presence and absence distinguishable. Trinary captures this: +1 is presence, -1 is absence, 0 is neither.

The structure also has natural symmetry. +1 and -1 are opposites; 0 is the axis. Both deviations from 0 create effects. This symmetry is absent from standard physics, which treats matter as positive and absence as... nothing.

## What This Dissolves

**Black hole singularities.** No infinite density needed. The center isn't infinitely compressed existence — it's absence. The boundary is where all the action is.

**The "what's inside" question.** All black hole observables are boundary properties: mass, spin, charge. No physical law requires anything inside. The trinary interpretation takes this seriously.

**The information paradox (sketch).** If information lives in boundary structure (as holographic principle suggests), and the interior is genuine absence, then information was never "inside" to be lost.

## What It Connects To

- **Wheeler's geometrodynamics:** "Mass without mass" — gravitational effects from pure geometry
- **Verlinde's entropic gravity:** Gravity as emergent from information/entropy at boundaries  
- **Tegmark's mathematical universe:** Reality IS mathematical structure, not merely described by it
- **Holographic principle:** Information encoded in boundary, not volume

The trinary framework synthesizes these — and adds the symmetric-attractor structure (both +1 and -1 curving spacetime) that none of them provide.

## What Would Make It Work

1. **Specify f.** The framework claims reality is a recursive function f: {-1,0,+1} → {-1,0,+1}. Without specifying f, no predictions follow.

2. **Derive something.** Start from trinary axioms, get something recognizable — a conservation law, locality, inverse square behavior.

3. **Show Lorentz invariance emerges.** The emerged spacetime must be Lorentz-invariant to match observation. This is hard.

4. **Make a novel prediction.** Find something this framework predicts that standard physics doesn't.

**Current exploration:** Whether trinary cellular automata (Greenberg-Hastings style) produce emergent conservation laws or inverse-square-like behavior from local update rules.

## What I Don't Know

- How does +1 become -1 in gravitational collapse? (There's a sketch involving reorganization rather than transmutation — see companion.)
- What triggers the transition? Critical density? Gradient threshold?
- How do gradients work before geometry exists?
- Does the framework actually produce physics-like behavior when formalized?

## Status

This is a conceptual framework, not a predictive theory. It's a way of thinking about what exists, not (yet) a way of calculating what happens.

The question is whether the trinary structure does genuine explanatory work — whether something emerges from it that wouldn't emerge from alternatives.
