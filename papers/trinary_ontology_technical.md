# Trinary Discrete Ontology: Technical Companion

**Precedent analysis, objection responses, and speculative extensions**

*This is the detailed companion to the core paper. For the essential idea, see "Trinary Discrete Ontology" (core document).*

## Abstract

Proposed: reality consists of exactly three discrete states: +1 (existence/matter), 0 (neutral/space), and -1 (absence/black holes). Gravity emerges from state differences at boundaries, black holes are regions of absence rather than infinite density, and reality IS recursive self-applying mathematics rather than something described by mathematics.

Individual claims find precedent across digital physics, emergent gravity, and mathematical realism research programs. Wheeler's "mass without mass" geometrodynamics (1950s-60s) provides the closest historical parallel for the black-hole-as-absence interpretation.

The framework is compatible with Gödelian incompleteness (embraced as a feature at emergent levels, not avoided). However, major open problems remain: Lorentz invariance must emerge from the pre-geometric base, gradients need formalization in discrete terms, and the recursive function f is unspecified.

The specific trinary structure (+1/0/-1 as complete ontology) and integration of these ideas appears genuinely novel. A speculative extension maps the same structure to subatomic physics: matter (+1), energy (0), antimatter (-1). This converges with Dirac's original "holes" interpretation (1931), and the ALPHA-g experiment's 2023 confirmation that antimatter falls normally is consistent with (though does not uniquely confirm) the predicted +1/-1 gravitational symmetry.

## Part I: The Theory

### 1.1 Core Claims

Six foundational propositions:

1. **Trinary states**: Reality consists of exactly three discrete values: +1, 0, -1
2. **State interpretation**: +1 = existence/matter, 0 = neutral/space, -1 = absence/black holes
3. **Gravity as gradient**: Gravitational effects emerge from the steepness of transitions between states at boundaries, not from "mass" as substance
4. **Black holes as absence**: The -1 regions are literal holes - absence of existence - not compressed matter. "Mass" is measured at the boundary gradient, not contents
5. **Mathematical identity**: Reality IS recursive self-applying mathematics. The function f: {-1, 0, +1} → {-1, 0, +1} running on itself constitutes reality, requiring no substrate
6. **Fundamental discreteness**: Reality is quantized at the base level, not continuous

### 1.2 The Creation Narrative

A heuristic narrative for how structure might emerge (metaphor, not mechanism):

**Stage 1: Undifferentiated existence**
> "In the beginning there was: thing"

A single undifferentiated state. Not nothing, not something specific - just existence without distinction.

**Stage 2: Self-reference creates plurality**
> "Thing thought: I'm a thing. Why not another thing?"

Self-reference introduces distinction. The recognition "I am" implies "not-I" is conceivable. This is the symmetry-breaking problem: why differentiation rather than uniform sameness?

**Stage 3: Plurality necessitates space**
> "Thing 2 could not exist separately without space - so that was the big bang"

Two things cannot be two without somewhere to be two *in*. Space isn't a pre-existing container - space is what "more than one" *means*. The Big Bang is reframed as the logical necessity of plurality rather than an event that "happened."

**Stage 4: Change creates time**
> "Things thought: what if we could travel through states? So they created time, which is still logging all things to this day."

Time isn't a dimension we move through. Time is the *record* of state changes - "existence keeping receipts."

**Addressing the bootstrap problem**: This seems circular - "records" require ordering, and ordering seems to presuppose time. But the ordering here is *logical dependency*, not temporal sequence. State B logically depends on state A (B couldn't exist without A existing first in the causal/logical chain), so A "precedes" B in dependency order. Time emerges as the structure of this dependency graph.

This is similar to how causal set theory handles time: not as a pre-existing dimension, but as the ordering implied by causal/logical relations between events. The "log" is the dependency structure itself.

**The Bootstrap Sequence:**
```
thing → self-reference → distinction → space → change → time → 
memory → complexity → perception → consciousness
```

This creates a strange loop: the creation myth ends with beings capable of reconstructing the sequence. "The log that includes the entry about logs being created."

### 1.3 The Trinary Interpretation

| State | Value | Manifestation | Character |
|-------|-------|---------------|-----------|
| Existence | +1 | Matter, stars, planets | "Something is HERE" |
| Neutral | 0 | Space, vacuum | "No question asked" |
| Absence | -1 | Black holes | "Nothing is HERE" |

**Critical reframing of space**: The 0 state is not "uncertainty between existence and absence." It's a third category entirely - the neutral canvas. Not probability = 0.5, but rather the condition where the question of existence/absence isn't being asked.

**Critical reframing of black holes**: Current physics models black holes as extreme concentrations of mass - infinite density at the singularity. This theory inverts that: black holes are regions where existence has value -1. They're *holes* in the literal sense. The "mass" we attribute to them is actually the steepness of the gradient at the event horizon - the boundary between 0 (space) and -1 (absence).

### 1.4 Gravity as Gradient

Both +1 (matter) and -1 (holes) create gravitational effects because both represent deviations from neutral. The gravitational effect isn't proportional to "stuff" but to *certainty* - how sharply the state transitions from neutral to resolved.

```
Observable gravitational strength ∝ |ΔS|

Where S is the state value and ΔS is the state difference between adjacent regions
```

**Important caveat**: The notation above uses continuous gradient language (∇S) as shorthand, but the theory claims discrete, pre-geometric foundations. Strictly speaking, "gradient" presupposes geometric structure (topology, differential structure, metric) that hasn't yet emerged.

What's actually meant: state differences between adjacent nodes in an underlying discrete structure - something like graph adjacency rather than continuous derivatives. The continuous gradient picture is an emergent approximation at scales where spacetime appears smooth. Formalizing how "adjacency" is defined pre-geometrically is an open problem (see Section 4.1).

A star (cluster of +1) curves spacetime because it's a sharp peak of existence in a sea of 0. A black hole (region of -1) curves spacetime because it's a sharp pit of absence. Both are attractors. The state difference at boundaries is what we measure.

This explains why black holes have "mass" despite being empty: we're not measuring contents, we're measuring the slope of the drain.

### 1.5 Recursive Self-Application

The deepest claim: reality doesn't exist *within* mathematics. Reality *IS* mathematics executing itself.

```
f: {-1, 0, +1} → {-1, 0, +1}
```

The function f, recursively applied, constitutes everything. No substrate underneath. No container around it. The recursion is the territory.

- **What f specifically is** = what physics tries to discover
- **Physical constants** = properties of f, not fundamental
- **Different f** = different universe
- **Our physics** = reverse-engineering f from inside

This dissolves the question "why is mathematics so effective at describing reality?" There's no description. Identity.

---

## Part II: Precedent Analysis

### 2.1 Mathematical Realism / Mathematical Universe Hypothesis

Max Tegmark's Mathematical Universe Hypothesis (2008) argues that physical reality is identical to mathematical structure - not merely described by mathematics. This aligns directly with the recursive self-application claim.

**Key quote from Tegmark**: "If an external physical reality exists independently of humans, and it can be completely described mathematically, then the physical world IS an abstract mathematical structure."

The theory's claim that f: {-1, 0, +1} → {-1, 0, +1} running on itself requires no substrate matches Tegmark's "baggage-free" description where mathematical structures exist without underlying medium.

**Alignment**: Strong
**Divergence**: Tegmark allows all mathematical structures; this theory claims exactly three states are sufficient/necessary

### 2.2 Digital Physics / Discrete Ontology

Multiple research programs propose discrete, computational foundations:

- **Konrad Zuse (1969)**: "Rechnender Raum" - universe as cellular automaton
- **Ed Fredkin**: Digital philosophy - all changes are digital informational processes
- **Stephen Wolfram (2020)**: Hypergraph structures with discrete update rules
- **John Wheeler (1989)**: "It from Bit" - reality derives from binary yes/no answers

Wheeler's formulation is particularly relevant: "Every particle, every field of force, even the spacetime continuum itself derives its function, its meaning, its very existence entirely from apparatus-elicited answers to yes-or-no questions, binary choices, bits."

**Alignment**: Strong on discreteness
**Divergence**: Most digital physics is binary; this theory is trinary. No existing theory uses exactly +1/0/-1 as fundamental.

### 2.3 Emergent Gravity / Entropic Gravity

Erik Verlinde's entropic gravity (2010) reformulates gravity as emerging from entropy gradients:

```
F = T∇S
Force = Temperature × Entropy Gradient
```

Verlinde: Gravity exists because of "a difference in concentration of information in the empty space between two masses and its surroundings."

Ted Jacobson (1995) derived Einstein's field equations from thermodynamic equilibrium at local horizon boundaries. Thanu Padmanabhan extended this to cosmic expansion.

**Alignment**: Very strong. "Gravity from gradients at boundaries" is essentially Verlinde's position restated in trinary terms.
**Divergence**: Verlinde doesn't specify an underlying trinary ontology. This theory provides one.

### 2.4 Black Holes as Absence / Precedent in Physics

This claim initially appears heterodox but finds conceptual precedent in physics - not as identical claims, but as evidence that mainstream physics already entertains "something other than compressed matter" at black hole cores.

**Important clarification**: The trinary -1 state is NOT equivalent to "negative pressure" or "dark energy." The -1 is a fundamental discrete state meaning "absence of existence" - it operates at a level more primitive than concepts like pressure, energy density, or stress-energy tensors. Those are emergent descriptions, not fundamental.

**Gravastars as conceptual precedent** (not equivalence):

Gravastars (Mazur & Mottola, 2001 preprint; PNAS 2004) propose that black hole interiors contain dark energy cores rather than singularities. This is relevant not because -1 = dark energy, but because:
- Physics already takes seriously the idea that black holes aren't "stuff compressed to infinity"
- Alternative interior states can produce identical external gravitational signatures
- "Mass" can be a boundary property rather than interior contents

Note: Chirenti & Rezzolla (2016) found gravastar ringdown signatures differ from standard black holes in gravitational wave observations. This constrains gravastars specifically but not the trinary interpretation, which makes different claims about what -1 regions are.

**Additional conceptual support:**

- **Wheeler's Geometrodynamics (1950s-60s)**: Wheeler's "geons" demonstrated that gravitational effects could arise from pure geometry without fundamental matter particles - "mass without mass." This establishes precedent for the idea that what we measure as "mass" need not be "stuff inside." However, Wheeler himself still viewed black holes as containing singularities; he is a precedent for *gravity without matter*, not specifically for *black holes as absence*.
- **Firewall Paradox (AMPS, 2012)**: Led to speculation that "space ends at the horizon"
- **Ahmed Farag Ali's Gravity's Rainbow (2015)**: "Black holes do not exist where space and time do not exist"

**Counter-examples**: String theory's fuzzball proposal fills black holes with string tangles. Loop quantum gravity replaces singularities with bounces. These go the opposite direction.

**Assessment**: The "black hole as absence" interpretation is genuinely novel. Wheeler's geometrodynamics establishes that "mass" can be a geometric property rather than a substance, which supports the interpretive direction, though Wheeler did not himself propose black holes as absence.

### 2.5 Empirical Compatibility: LIGO, Hawking Radiation, and the No-Hair Theorem

Initial objections claimed the theory contradicts gravitational wave observations. Upon analysis, these objections rest on misunderstandings of the theory's claims.

**Black Hole Merger Energy (LIGO)**

In GW150914, two black holes (36 + 29 solar masses) merged to form a 62 solar mass remnant, releasing approximately 3 solar masses as gravitational wave energy. The objection: "Where does energy come from if black holes are empty?"

**Resolution**: The energy comes from boundary reconfiguration, not contents.

When two -1 regions merge:
1. Each has steep gradients at its boundary (what we measure as "mass")
2. The merger reconfigures the boundary topology
3. The combined gradient profile differs from the sum of separate gradients
4. The difference propagates as ripples through the surrounding 0-state regions (gravitational waves)

This is analogous to two vortices merging in water - energy is released from surface dynamics, not from "stuff in the vortices." The vortices are absences (holes in the water) yet their merger involves real energy dynamics at boundaries.

**Important**: This is not a claim about "gravitational field energy" - the trinary theory operates below the level where "fields" exist. The gradient IS the fundamental description, not a field carrying the gradient.

**Addressing the stress-energy objection:**

One might ask: "How does 'absence' generate the positive stress-energy tensor required for exterior Schwarzschild geometry?"

This objection is based on a misunderstanding. The Schwarzschild exterior is a **vacuum solution** - T_μν = 0 everywhere outside the horizon. There IS no stress-energy in the exterior region. The "mass" M appears as an integration constant (a boundary condition in the geometry), not as a local matter source.

The exterior geometry doesn't require "positive stress-energy inside" - it only requires that the boundary conditions be set correctly. Whether those conditions arise from compressed matter, a singularity, or a -1 state is not determined by the exterior solution itself.

Gravastars need exotic matter at their shell because they need something to *halt collapse* - to hold the boundary stable against gravitational infall. But in the trinary interpretation, there's no collapse to stop. The -1 state simply IS that state. It's not matter that fell in and needs to be supported; it's a fundamental condition.

The symmetry: +1 (existence) creates a peak in the state configuration → steep gradient → spacetime curvature. -1 (absence) creates a pit in the state configuration → steep gradient → spacetime curvature. Both are deviations from neutral (0). The Schwarzschild solution describes the geometry of such a deviation without specifying what's "at the center."

**The No-Hair Theorem**

The no-hair theorem states black holes are characterized ONLY by mass, angular momentum, and charge - all measurable from outside. You never need to know what's "inside."

This actually SUPPORTS the trinary interpretation. If black holes were "stuff compressed," interior properties should matter. Instead, all observable properties are boundary properties - consistent with there being no "inside" in the classical sense, just gradient characteristics.

**Hawking Radiation**

Standard interpretation: Virtual particle pairs form near the horizon; one falls in, one escapes; the black hole loses mass.

Trinary reinterpretation: At the boundary between 0 (space) and -1 (absence), instability exists. Some 0-state regions get pulled toward -1 but probabilistically flip to +1 instead and escape. The "evaporation" is the hole gradually healing as boundary fluctuations chip away at it.

This reframing preserves the observable predictions while dissolving the "information paradox" - information was never "inside" to be lost; it existed in boundary structure all along.

**Rotation and Angular Momentum**

Objection: "How can nothing rotate?"

Resolution: A whirlpool rotates. The hole itself is absence of water. The rotation is a property of the boundary dynamics, not "stuff inside" spinning. Angular momentum lives in the gradient structure, not contents. The event horizon's frame-dragging effect is the rotation of the transition region between states.

**Black Hole Formation: The +1 → -1 Transition**

Objection: "Stars are matter (+1). When they collapse into black holes, they become -1. Where did the +1 go?"

This is a serious question. 

**What the framework explains (mass conservation):**

Mass = gradient magnitude at boundary. And |+1 - 0| = |-1 - 0|. Both +1 and -1 deviate from neutral by the same amount. So when a region transitions from +1 to -1, the gradient magnitude is naturally preserved. What scales is boundary size - more +1 collapsing → larger -1 region → larger boundary → more total "mass."

This connects to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy (∝ horizon area) and holographic ideas: information/mass lives in boundary structure.

**Speculative mechanism (vortex model):**

Maybe +1 doesn't *become* -1. Maybe extreme +1 concentration creates dynamics that *leave* a -1 region in the center - like a vortex forming in water. Water doesn't become hole; water organizes *around* a hole.

If this is right:
- The +1 is still there (reorganized into boundary/horizon structure)
- The -1 forms in the center as a consequence of the +1 configuration
- Mass is conserved because the +1 didn't leave, it reorganized
- The structure is self-sustaining

**What remains open:**

Even with this sketch, key questions remain: What determines the critical threshold? How does the transition propagate? Is it instantaneous or gradual? The framework poses these questions clearly but doesn't answer them. Formalizing f might reveal whether such transitions are even possible within the trinary structure.

### 2.6 Three-Valued Logic in Physics

Three-valued logics have been applied to quantum mechanics:

- **Reichenbach (1944)**: True/False/Indeterminate for unmeasured quantities
- **Łukasiewicz logic**: Applied to superposition
- **Qutrit quantum computing**: Three-level quantum systems with demonstrated advantages

However, these treat the third value as *epistemic* indeterminacy (we don't know), not *ontological* neutrality (no question asked). The 0 in this theory is not "undecided between +1 and -1" but a genuine third state.

**Assessment**: Trinary logic exists in physics. The specific +1/0/-1 ontological interpretation appears novel.

---

## Part III: Novel Contributions

After extensive search, the following elements appear genuinely original:

### 3.1 The Specific Trinary Structure

No established physics or metaphysics theory uses exactly +1 (existence), 0 (neutral), -1 (absence) as complete ontological foundation. Balanced ternary number systems exist (Knuth noted they might "prove quite important someday") but weren't proposed as physically fundamental.

### 3.2 Black Holes as -1 Rather Than ∞

The reframing of black holes from "infinite density of +1" to "regions of -1" is not present in mainstream physics or alternatives surveyed. This creates symmetric attractors: both extreme presence and extreme absence curve spacetime.

### 3.3 Space as Neutral (Not Uncertainty)

Most quantum interpretations treat empty space as quantum foam, vacuum fluctuations, virtual particles - activity. This theory treats space as genuinely neutral: not "probability 0.5" but "no question being asked." This is philosophically distinct.

### 3.4 Time as Logging Function

The characterization of time as "existence keeping receipts" rather than a dimension adds to block universe vs. presentism debates. Time doesn't *contain* events; time *is* the record of state changes. This connects to but differs from process philosophy.

### 3.5 Integration

Most critically: no existing theory combines all these elements. Tegmark allows mathematical realism but doesn't specify trinary. Verlinde provides gradient gravity but no underlying ontology. Wheeler proposed "mass without mass" but used binary "it from bit." Digital physics is typically binary.

The combination appears to be genuinely novel synthesis.

---

## Part IV: Challenges and Open Problems

Some challenges facing discrete/computational ontologies apply to this theory; others are dissolved by its specific structure.

### 4.1 Lorentz Invariance (Major Open Problem)

**The standard problem for discrete spacetime theories**: If a fundamental length scale exists (discrete cells in spacetime), boosted observers should see it Lorentz-contracted below the fundamental scale.

**Why the usual objection doesn't directly apply**: 

The theory doesn't claim discrete cells *in* spacetime. It claims spacetime *emerges from* the recursive trinary operation. The discreteness is pre-geometric - in the mathematical structure itself, not in a spatial grid.

No-go theorems about discrete networks (e.g., Hossenfelder 2015) prove you can't have Lorentz-invariant discrete structures embedded IN Minkowski spacetime. But this is irrelevant here - the trinary theory doesn't embed anything in spacetime. Spacetime is emergent, not fundamental. The theorem's premises simply don't apply.

**However, the problem transforms rather than disappears:**

Being pre-geometric doesn't exempt the theory from explaining Lorentz invariance - it just moves the requirement to the emergence step. If spacetime emerges from trinary recursion, then:
- The emergent spacetime must either respect or violate Lorentz symmetry
- We observe Lorentz invariance to extraordinary precision (~10⁻²³ from cosmic ray observations)
- Therefore the theory must explain *how* Lorentz-invariant spacetime emerges

This is analogous to the "continuum limit" problem in loop quantum gravity. LQG is also pre-geometric, but its practitioners spend enormous effort showing that smooth, Lorentz-invariant spacetime emerges at large scales. The trinary framework faces the same challenge.

**Addressing the Collins fine-tuning problem:**

Collins, Perez, and Sudarsky (2004) showed that if you have discrete structure at the Planck scale, quantum field theory radiative corrections propagate that discreteness upward, generating macroscopic Lorentz violations. This requires extreme fine-tuning to suppress.

However, this argument targets discrete structures that exist AT a scale within spacetime (like a Planck-scale lattice). In the trinary theory, spacetime itself emerges from the recursion. The radiative corrections can't "see" the underlying trinary structure because they exist at a level where spacetime already exists.

The question becomes: does the trinary recursion produce Lorentz-invariant spacetime? This is unknown. The observational constraints are extraordinarily stringent - LHAASO observations (2022) establish limits of 10⁵ × Planck energy, GRB time-of-flight measurements (2024) give ~10 × Planck energy. Any successful formalization must reproduce this near-perfect Lorentz invariance.

**Status**: This is a major open problem, not a solved one. The theory has a plausible path (emergence from pre-geometric structure, as in causal set theory) but hasn't demonstrated it works.

### 4.2 Self-Reference and Completeness

**The standard objection**: Gödel's incompleteness theorems show sufficiently powerful formal systems are either incomplete or inconsistent. A "self-applying function" faces Tarski's undefinability theorem.

**The dilemma**: If f is rich enough to generate physics (which includes counting, addition, multiplication - all the mathematics physics uses), then f is expressive enough for Gödel to apply. If f is too primitive for Gödel, it can't generate physics.

**Resolution**: Accept incompleteness as a feature, not a bug.

The base trinary operation may be sub-Gödelian (like Boolean logic or Presburger arithmetic). But emergent structures at higher levels - the physics that arises from recursive application - would exhibit arithmetic and thus incompleteness.

This is consistent with the framework's own logic: existence can't fully model itself. The bootstrap sequence never "completes." Consciousness observing existence generates endless recursion. Incompleteness isn't a limitation imposed from outside - it's built into what self-reference means.

The theory doesn't need to escape Gödel. It needs to be *compatible* with incompleteness - which it is, since incompleteness at emergent levels doesn't prevent the base recursion from operating.

### 4.3 The Measure Problem (Possibly Dissolved)

**The problem for other theories**: In Tegmark's Mathematical Universe Hypothesis, all mathematical structures exist. This creates a measure problem: how do you assign probabilities? Why THIS configuration rather than another? Both numerator and denominator are infinite.

**Why this theory may avoid it**: The trinary framework doesn't posit an ensemble of possible structures. It posits ONE structure: f operating on {-1, 0, +1}, recursively. There's no "space of alternatives" requiring weighting.

Asking "why this f rather than some other f?" presupposes a selector outside the system choosing between options. But if the recursive operation IS reality (not one of many possible realities), there's no outside from which to select, and no ensemble to measure over.

**Our argument** (not established in literature): This follows from the Occam's razor principle - adding an explanation for what "chose" the structure would be adding an entity the framework doesn't require. The question "why this rather than that" may be a category error, like asking "why does 2+2=4?" - it assumes contingency where there may be none.

Note: This argument is novel to this theory. No published literature explicitly makes this case. The claim stands on its logical merits, not on authority.

**Caveat**: The "single structure" deflection only works cleanly if that structure is finite. If f produces an infinite recursive structure, a measure problem may reappear: how do you weight different regions or configurations within the infinite structure? This would be analogous to the measure problem in eternal inflation (within a single universe, not across universes). Whether this is a genuine problem depends on details of formalization.

The measure problem is primarily a problem for multiverse theories. This is a single-universe theory - but the extent to which that dissolves the problem depends on the structure's finitude.

### 4.4 Deriving Specific Physics

**The gap**: The theory says f: {-1, 0, +1} → {-1, 0, +1} running recursively. But how does this produce:
- Electrons with specific mass
- Inverse square law for gravity
- Quantum entanglement
- The Standard Model particle zoo
- Specific physical constants (fine structure constant, etc.)

**The work**: Either the trinary structure constrains outcomes enough that specific physics emerges necessarily, or additional specification is needed. This is where formalization would succeed or fail.

### 4.5 Continuous Symmetries

**The problem**: The Standard Model and general relativity use continuous Lie groups (U(1), SU(2), SU(3), general covariance). How do these emerge from discrete three-state foundations?

**Analogy**: Crystals are discrete but can support continuous-looking waves in the long-wavelength limit. Perhaps continuous symmetries are emergent approximations.

### 4.6 Consciousness

**The problem**: Even if the mathematical structure is correct, why does computation feel like anything? The "hard problem" of qualia isn't dissolved by discreteness.

**The theory's position**: The bootstrap sequence includes "perception" and "consciousness" as stages of recursive self-modeling. But this describes, not explains. The theory might simply accept consciousness as what recursive self-reference *is* at sufficient complexity.

### 4.7 Time Dilation (Compatible)

**The apparent problem**: If time is merely "logging," how does time dilation work? GPS satellites, muon decay, and the twin paradox all demonstrate real physical differences in elapsed time.

**Resolution**: The theory doesn't deny time dilation happens. It reframes what's dilating.

In the trinary interpretation, "time" is state-transition rate. Near strong +1 clusters (mass) or -1 pits (black holes), the gradient affects how rapidly transitions occur. Different regions have different recursion rates. The dilation is real - what's dilating is the pace of the underlying computation, not motion through a pre-existing time dimension.

This is compatible with special and general relativity's predictions. Clocks near massive objects tick slower because the state-transition rate is lower in steep gradient regions. The twin paradox produces real age differences because one twin's recursion ran through fewer iterations.

The reframing changes interpretation, not observable predictions.

### 4.8 Testability (Open Challenge)

**The problem**: What observations would falsify trinary ontology? This challenge faces all foundational theories (string theory, loop quantum gravity, Tegmark's MUH).

**The honest answer**: Direct empirical tests are currently unavailable. The theory operates at a level more fundamental than current experiments can probe.

**Possible indirect approaches:**

*Mathematical derivation:*
- If the trinary structure necessarily produces specific constraints (a constant, a symmetry, a relationship), those could be checked against observation
- Prove emergent Lorentz invariance from the recursion
- Derive the particle spectrum or coupling constants from first principles
- Show that known physics emerges naturally while competitor theories require fine-tuning

*Speculative observational differences:*
- Late-stage black hole evaporation: what happens when a -1 region fully "heals"? Does it differ from standard predictions?
- Information paradox: if information exists in boundary structure rather than "inside," predictions may differ at Planck-scale precision
- Quantum gravity phenomenology: if we ever access Planck-scale physics directly

*Falsification conditions:*
- Discovery that black hole interiors definitively contain matter (though it's unclear how this could be observed from outside)
- Proof that Lorentz invariance cannot emerge from any discrete pre-geometric structure
- Demonstration that the trinary structure is mathematically inconsistent

**Assessment**: The theory is not currently testable in the direct experimental sense. It stands or falls on internal consistency, explanatory power, and whether formalization produces derivable predictions. This is comparable to the status of other quantum gravity approaches - not a unique weakness, but an acknowledged limitation.

---

## Part V: Paths Toward Formalization

### 5.1 Cellular Automata Approaches

Three-state totalistic automata are well-studied. The Greenberg-Hastings automaton uses three states (resting → excited → refractory). However, these are phenomenological models, not fundamental theories.

**Research direction**: Identify whether any three-state CA produces physics-like behavior (conservation laws, locality, reversibility).

### 5.2 Category Theory

A category with three objects and morphisms between them, with an endofunctor representing self-application, might formalize the recursive structure.

**Research direction**: Does the category of trinary relations have closure properties that could generate spacetime?

### 5.3 Information Theory

The theory aligns with information-theoretic approaches:
- Information requires difference
- Difference requires distinguishability
- Distinguishability requires space
- Change requires sequence
- Sequence is time

**Research direction**: Derive spacetime geometry from information-theoretic axioms using trinary alphabet.

### 5.4 Empirical Differentiation

Verlinde's entropic gravity makes predictions that differ from GR at galactic scales. A 2016 Leiden Observatory study found gravitational lensing consistent with Verlinde; a 2017 Princeton study found inconsistencies with dwarf galaxies.

**Research direction**: Does the trinary gradient formulation make different predictions than Verlinde? If so, the theories are distinguishable.

For black holes: Firewall theories, gravastars, and fuzzballs make different predictions about Hawking radiation spectra and gravitational wave signatures. If "black hole as -1" makes specific predictions about event horizon structure or merger dynamics, these could be tested.

### 5.5 Quantum Computing Tests

IBM Quantum and similar platforms allow small-scale experiments:
- Test if entangled systems show spatial preferences when measured
- Look for non-randomness in quantum distributions
- Probe whether decoherence patterns suggest underlying geometry

These test whether "structure has a signature" - whether differentiation follows patterns (spirals, fractals, preferred configurations) that might indicate constraints from the trinary foundation.

---

## Part VI: Assessment

### 6.1 Is This Physics or Philosophy?

Currently philosophy - a conceptual framework, not a predictive model. But so was atomism for 2,400 years before becoming chemistry. The question is whether formalization would yield predictions.

### 6.2 Is This Profound or Trivial?

**Trivial reading**: "Call matter +1, space 0, absence -1, claim math is real." Relabeling.

**Profound reading**: The relabeling creates symmetric structure (both +1 and -1 are deviations from 0), reframes black holes as absence rather than presence, provides generative account of space and time, and achieves ontological minimalism (three states, one operation, no substrate).

The difference depends on whether the trinary structure does genuine explanatory work - whether it predicts something that emerges naturally from the framework that wouldn't emerge from alternatives.

### 6.3 Viability Assessment

|-----------|--------|------------|

| +1 → -1 trigger condition | **Sketched** | Critical density threshold, analogous to neutron degeneracy collapse |
| Antimatter into black hole | **Resolved** | Falls in normally; boundary structure absorbed into horizon; mass increases as expected |
| Photon vs space (both 0?) | **Sketched** | Photon = propagating boundary disturbance through 0 canvas. Non-annihilation photons, photon properties, vacuum energy remain open. |
| Gradient definition | **Open** | Pre-geometric gradients need formalization |

**Strengths**:
- Extreme minimalism (three values, recursive function)
- Aligns with active research programs (Verlinde's entropic gravity, Tegmark's MUH, Wheeler's geometrodynamics)
- Resolves rather than creates mysteries (black hole singularities become -1 regions, no infinite density needed)
- Self-grounding (no infinite regress of substrates)
- Compatible with Gödelian incompleteness (embraced as feature, not avoided)
- Compatible with relativistic time dilation (reframed as variable state-transition rate)
- All black hole observables being boundary properties is consistent with -1 interpretation
- -1 dual meaning (black holes/antimatter) resolved via all-boundary vs boundary-with-interior distinction
- Mass conservation in collapse explained (gradient magnitude preserved: |+1-0| = |-1-0|)
- Connects to holographic principle (information in boundary structure)

**Weaknesses**:
- Large gap between framework and specific predictions (deriving Standard Model, constants)
- Must demonstrate emergence of Lorentz invariance from discrete base (major open problem)
- Must formalize how gradients work pre-geometrically
- Doesn't explain consciousness (only describes it as recursive self-modeling)
- Not directly testable - no novel empirical predictions yet derived (shared with all quantum gravity approaches)
- Must still show the trinary recursion actually produces physics-like behavior
- +1 → -1 transition mechanism and trigger condition sketched but not derived from framework
- Photon treatment incomplete: annihilation photons sketched, but non-annihilation photons, photon properties, and vacuum energy unexplained

**Comparison**: The theory faces substantial but not necessarily fatal challenges. These are comparable to problems facing all approaches to quantum gravity. Loop quantum gravity, string theory, and entropic gravity all have gaps between framework and full predictive power.

### 6.4 What Would Make This Succeed?

1. **Mathematical closure**: Show that three states with self-application necessarily produces specific constraints - not "anything could happen" but "only certain structures are stable"

2. **Derivation of known physics**: Start from trinary axioms, derive something recognizable (conservation law, locality, wave equation)

3. **Novel prediction**: Identify an observable that differs from standard physics and Verlinde's entropic gravity. Test it.

4. **Explanatory power**: Show that a known mystery (dark matter? dark energy? quantum gravity?) dissolves naturally in the trinary frame.

## Part VII: Speculative Extensions

*The following section explores how the trinary framework might extend to subatomic physics. These are speculative mappings, not core claims of the theory. They are included because they exhibit internal consistency and connect to established physics in interesting ways.*

### 7.1 The Antimatter Mapping

The trinary structure at macroscopic scales:

| State | Value | Manifestation |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| Existence | +1 | Matter (stars, planets) |
| Neutral | 0 | Space |
| Absence | -1 | Black holes |

What if this same structure recurses at the subatomic level?

| State | Value | Subatomic manifestation |
|-------|-------|------------------------|
| Existence | +1 | Matter particles (electron, proton, quark) |
| Neutral | 0 | Vacuum / space |
| Absence | -1 | Antimatter (positron, antiproton, antiquark) |

**The photon problem: What are photons in this framework?**

If space is 0 and photons come from annihilation (+1 + -1 → ?), where do photons fit?

**Sketch (not resolution):** The trinary states remain {-1, 0, +1} only. Energy isn't a fourth state - energy is a *property of boundaries* (gradient steepness). A photon isn't a "type of 0." A photon is a **propagating boundary disturbance** through the 0 canvas.

When matter meets antimatter: +1 + (-1) → 0. The states cancel. The boundary gradient energy doesn't vanish - it propagates outward as a pattern through the 0 regions. Like a wave on water: water doesn't become "wave-water," the wave is a pattern moving through water.

This preserves trinary:
- States: {-1, 0, +1} only
- Energy: boundary property, not a state
- Photon: propagating disturbance pattern, not a state value

**What this sketch explains:**
- Why photons are "neutral": the underlying states are 0
- Why pair production works: enough disturbance energy can "tear" 0 back into +1/-1 boundaries
- Why photons are their own antiparticle: 0 has no opposite

**What remains open:**
- How do non-annihilation photons fit? (atomic emission, synchrotron radiation, thermal radiation, CMB - these aren't +1/-1 cancellation events)
- Where do photon properties come from? (frequency, polarization, momentum)
- The cosmological constant problem: why does "empty" 0 have energy density?

This is a sketch pointing in a direction, not a complete treatment. Photons/energy require more development than the current framework provides.

**Addressing the dual-meaning tension**: Black holes and antimatter seem physically very different - black holes are gravitational wells you can't escape; antiparticles interact via all four forces and can be held (briefly) in magnetic traps. How can -1 mean both?

**Resolution: All-boundary vs boundary-with-interior**

The key distinction is *scale structure*:

- **Particle-scale -1 (antimatter)**: So small it's *all boundary*. No meaningful interior. The entire structure is gradient. Since all forces are gradient effects at different scales, antimatter interacts via all of them.

- **Macro-scale -1 (black hole)**: Has actual interior (absence) with boundary (event horizon). Only the boundary produces effects. The interior is genuine absence - nothing there to emit or interact.

This explains the apparent asymmetry:

| Property | Black Hole -1 | Antimatter -1 | Why |
|----------|---------------|---------------|-----|
| Interactions | Gravitational only | All four forces | BH: only boundary radiates. Antimatter: IS all boundary |
| Can escape? | No | Moves freely | BH: has interior to fall into. Antimatter: no interior, just boundary moving through 0 |
| Information | In boundary structure | In boundary structure | Same - both encode information at boundary |

**Mass conservation in the +1 → -1 transition:**

Why does a 10 solar mass star become a 10 solar mass black hole if the interior becomes "absence"?

Because mass = gradient magnitude at boundary, and |+1 - 0| = |-1 - 0|. Both deviate from neutral by the same amount. What scales is the *boundary size* - more +1 collapsing → larger -1 region → larger boundary → more total "mass."

This connects to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy (∝ horizon area). The mass/information is in boundary structure, proportional to boundary size. The trinary interpretation is consistent with holographic ideas.

**Symmetry across scales:**

| Scale | +1 | -1 |
|-------|----|----|
| Particle | All-boundary, interacts via all forces | All-boundary, interacts via all forces |
| Macro | Has interior (stuff), radiates/interacts | Has interior (absence), only boundary effects |

At particle scale, both +1 and -1 are boundary-dominated structures. At macro scale, the difference is what the interior IS: +1 interior contains stuff that can emit and radiate; -1 interior is absence (nothing to emit).

**The +1 → -1 transition mechanism:**

How does existence become absence? When a star collapses, what actually happens?

**Speculative sketch:** Maybe +1 doesn't *become* -1. Maybe extreme +1 concentration creates boundary dynamics that *leave* a -1 region in the center.

Analogy: A vortex in water. Water doesn't become hole. Water organizes *around* a hole. The absence forms as a consequence of how presence configures itself under extreme conditions.

If this is right:
- The +1 is still there (reorganized into boundary structure)
- The -1 forms in the center as a consequence of the +1 configuration
- This explains why mass is conserved (the +1 didn't leave, it just reorganized)
- The resulting structure is self-sustaining (like the eye of a hurricane)

**What triggers the transition?** Genuinely unknown. Speculative sketch: perhaps when local +1 density exceeds some threshold, the configuration becomes unstable — like matter compressed beyond neutron degeneracy pressure, but more fundamental. The +1 "inverts" around a nascent -1 core. What determines this threshold, and whether it emerges from the trinary structure or requires additional specification, is an open question.

This is speculative. The framework describes the before (concentrated +1) and after (-1 region with +1 boundary) with preserved gradient magnitude. But whether the transition works this way, or some other way, or at all - that requires formalizing f.

**Edge case: antimatter falling into a black hole**

What happens when particle-scale -1 (antimatter) encounters macro-scale -1 (black hole)?

Answer: it falls in normally. Both have positive gravitational effect (|ΔS| = 1 either way), so the antimatter is attracted to the black hole like anything else. The particle crosses the boundary and... then what?

"Contains" is the wrong frame. The interior is absence — there's nothing to be "in." The particle's boundary structure (which is all an antiparticle is) gets absorbed into the horizon's boundary structure. The black hole's mass increases by the antiparticle's mass, just as it would for a matter particle.

This is consistent: both +1 and -1 falling into a black hole increase its boundary gradient (mass). The interior remains absence; the information lives in the boundary.

### 7.2 Annihilation as State Transformation

When matter meets antimatter, they annihilate into photons:

```
electron + positron → 2 photons (1.022 MeV total)
```

In trinary terms: a +1 state meets a -1 state → ontological cancellation to 0. The states cancel. But the boundary gradient energy doesn't vanish - it propagates outward as a disturbance through the 0 canvas. The 1.022 MeV is the released gradient energy.

**Photons as propagating boundary disturbance**: The trinary states remain {-1, 0, +1} only. A photon isn't a fourth state or a "type of 0." It's a pattern of disturbance propagating through 0 regions - like a wave on water. The water doesn't become "wave-water"; the wave is a pattern moving through water.

The process is reversible: pair production creates matter-antimatter pairs from sufficient photon energy (minimum 1.022 MeV, requiring a third body for momentum conservation). Enough disturbance energy can "tear" 0 back into +1/-1 boundaries.

The structural parallel to black hole mergers:
- Two opposite deviations from neutral
- Meeting at a boundary  
- Transforming into a different state
- Energy dynamics at the transition

This is a structural analogy, not a claim that the mechanisms are identical. Standard physics describes annihilation as mass-energy conversion (E = mc²); the trinary framework offers a different interpretive lens on the same mathematics.

**Acknowledged limitation**: This sketch addresses annihilation photons but doesn't explain photons from other sources (atomic emission, thermal radiation, etc.). The treatment of energy/photons remains incomplete.

### 7.3 Dirac's Sea: Convergent Reasoning

Paul Dirac's 1928 equation permitted negative energy solutions, but he initially dismissed them. In 1930, he proposed "hole theory" - initially (incorrectly) identifying holes as protons. After Oppenheimer and Weyl proved this impossible, Dirac explicitly predicted antimatter in May 1931: "A hole, if there were one, would be a new kind of particle, unknown to experimental physics, having the same mass and opposite charge to an electron. We may call such a particle an anti-electron."

Carl Anderson discovered the positron in 1932, confirming the prediction.

The key point: Dirac literally described positrons as *absences* - holes in a filled sea. From his 1933 Nobel lecture: "An unoccupied negative-energy state, or hole, as we may call it for brevity, will have a positive energy, since it is a place where there is a shortage of negative energy."

The Dirac Sea was later displaced (not refuted) by quantum field theory's particle/antiparticle formalism. The two are mathematically equivalent via Bogoliubov transformations. The "holes" picture remains actively used in solid-state physics (semiconductor holes are exactly this concept).

The trinary framework arrives at the same structure from different reasoning:
- Dirac: mathematical consequence of relativistic quantum mechanics
- Trinary: -1 as fundamental state of absence

This convergence is striking. Dirac's original intuition - antimatter as *absence* - may be closer to fundamental truth than the later formalization suggests.

### 7.4 Matter-Antimatter Asymmetry

The universe is overwhelmingly matter-dominated. If +1 and -1 are symmetric states, why is there more matter than antimatter?

**Current physics status**: CP violation (where matter and antimatter behave slightly differently) is one of Sakharov's three necessary conditions for baryogenesis (1967). However, **Standard Model CP violation is many orders of magnitude too small** to explain the observed asymmetry. No consensus mechanism exists - leading candidates include leptogenesis, electroweak baryogenesis, and GUT-scale processes.

Possible trinary interpretations:

**Initial asymmetry**: The original differentiation had a slight bias. When the undifferentiated state first split into +1 and -1, fractionally more +1 crystallized. The mechanism for this bias would need to be specified.

**Fundamental asymmetry in f**: The recursive operation itself might not treat +1 and -1 perfectly symmetrically. This would be analogous to CP violation but at the foundational level.

**Observational selection**: Speculative - regions dominated by -1 (antimatter) might exist elsewhere. This is disfavored by observations (no gamma-ray signatures from matter-antimatter domain boundaries have been detected).

The matter-antimatter asymmetry remains an open problem in physics. The trinary framework doesn't solve it but provides a different vocabulary for framing the question.

### 7.5 Virtual Particles: A Heuristic Picture

Quantum field theory describes the vacuum as containing "virtual particle-antiparticle pairs."

**Important caveat**: The "virtual particles popping in and out of existence" picture is a pedagogical metaphor, not rigorous physics. Virtual particles are internal lines in Feynman diagrams - mathematical terms in perturbation theory. They don't violate energy conservation; as the DESY Physics FAQ states: "all this talk of virtual states is just an approximation to quantum mechanics, in which energy is conserved at all times."

With that caveat, the *heuristic* trinary interpretation:

```
0 ↔ (+1, -1)
vacuum ↔ (particle, antiparticle)
```

The neutral state has structure that can be decomposed into +1/-1 pairs mathematically. This is analogous to how zero can be written as (+1) + (-1).

Similarly, the "virtual particle pairs at the event horizon" picture of Hawking radiation is explicitly heuristic. Hawking himself (1975): "these pictures of the mechanism responsible for the thermal emission... are heuristic only and should not be taken too literally." The actual calculation uses Bogoliubov transformations between vacuum states.

The trinary framework's value here is conceptual, not calculational - it provides an interpretive lens, not a replacement for QFT mathematics.

### 7.6 Electric Charge as Gradient Direction

*Note: This section is particularly speculative and has unresolved tensions. It's included to show the framework's potential scope, not as a developed claim.*

Within matter (+1), we observe positive and negative electric charges. But both protons and electrons are "matter" - neither is antimatter. How does charge fit?

Speculative proposal: **charge is gradient direction**.

| Property | Trinary interpretation |
|----------|----------------------|
| State value (+1, 0, -1) | What kind of thing (matter, space, antimatter) |
| Gradient direction | Which way the state slopes → electric charge |
| Gradient magnitude | How steep the slope → mass/gravitational effect |

Positive charge: local gradient slopes "upward" (toward +1)
Negative charge: local gradient slopes "downward" (toward -1)
Neutral: flat gradient locally (neutron, neutrino, photon)

**Why opposites attract**: Opposing gradient directions tend to flatten out. The system moves toward configurations with less total gradient steepness - a structural tendency, not "energy" in the thermodynamic sense.

**Why like charges repel**: Parallel gradients reinforce each other, creating steep configurations. The system moves away from such arrangements.

**Unresolved tension**: If electrons "slope toward -1," what stops them from reaching it? Electrons are extremely stable (lifetime > 10²⁸ years). They don't spontaneously become positrons or disappear. This requires explanation. Similarly, if protons "slope toward +1" but ARE +1, what does that mean? The gradient picture for charge doesn't cleanly work out and needs significant development.

**Theoretical precedent**: The idea that charge relates to geometry has significant history:
- **Kaluza-Klein theory (1921-1926)**: In 5D spacetime, electric charge emerges as momentum in the extra dimension. Opposite charges = motion in opposite directions.
- **Wheeler's geometrodynamics**: Proposed "charge without charge" - electric field lines passing through wormholes rather than ending at point charges.

Einstein spent his final 30+ years attempting geometric unification of gravity and electromagnetism without success. The problem remains open. The trinary gradient interpretation is speculative but connects to a legitimate research tradition.

### 7.7 Fractal Structure Hypothesis

If the trinary structure operates at both macro and subatomic scales, perhaps similar patterns appear at multiple scales:

```
Stellar scale:   stars (+1) / space (0) / black holes (-1)
Atomic scale:    matter (+1) / vacuum (0) / antimatter (-1)
```

**Important caveats**: Strict scale invariance ("the same pattern at every scale") is not supported by mainstream physics:
- Different physics regimes govern different scales (quantum mechanics, classical mechanics, general relativity)
- The atomic-planetary analogy (Rutherford model) failed - electrons don't orbit classically
- Galaxy distributions show fractal properties only to ~20 Mpc; beyond ~100 Mpc, large-scale homogeneity is confirmed

The trinary claim is weaker: not that physics is identical at all scales, but that the *same three-state ontology* underlies different manifestations. +1/0/-1 might manifest as matter/space/black holes at one scale and particles/vacuum/antiparticles at another, with different dynamics but the same foundational structure.

This is speculative and would require substantial mathematical development to test.

### 7.8 Status of These Extensions

These mappings are **speculative**, not established claims. They are included because:

1. They are internally consistent with the trinary framework
2. They connect to real physics (Dirac's holes, CP violation)
3. They suggest research directions for formalization
4. They demonstrate the framework's potential explanatory scope

**Antimatter gravity - now experimentally confirmed**:

The ALPHA-g experiment at CERN (September 2023, published in Nature) achieved the first direct measurement of antimatter's gravitational behavior. Result: antihydrogen falls *down* with gravitational acceleration (0.75 ± 0.13)g - consistent with general relativity's prediction.

This is **consistent with** the trinary framework's prediction that both +1 and -1 states create attractive gravity. If -1 (antimatter) had repulsive gravity, the symmetry would be broken in a way the theory doesn't predict.

**Important caveat**: This was not a unique prediction. General relativity already predicted antimatter has positive gravitational mass (the equivalence principle demands it). ALPHA-g confirmed GR, not specifically the trinary framework. The value is *consistency* - ruling out antigravity scenarios that would have contradicted the +1/-1 symmetry - not *confirmation*.

**Remaining falsification conditions**:
- Proof that charge cannot be reduced to gradient properties
- Demonstration that the annihilation energy relationship violates the proposed +1 ↔ -1 symmetry
- Discovery of fundamental asymmetry in matter/antimatter behavior beyond what CP violation produces (the ALPHA-g precision of ~20% leaves room for subtle differences)

These extensions would need substantial mathematical development before becoming testable claims.

## Conclusion

Trinary Discrete Ontology combines insights from Tegmark's Mathematical Universe Hypothesis (reality IS math), Verlinde's entropic gravity (gravity from gradients), Wheeler's geometrodynamics ("mass without mass"), and digital physics (discrete foundation) - but diverges from all by proposing exactly three ontological states with specific interpretations as complete.

**What the framework handles:**
- Gödelian incompleteness is embraced as a feature at emergent levels, not avoided
- Black hole observations are consistent with -1 regions (all observables are boundary properties)
- Time dilation is compatible (reframed as variable state-transition rate)
- The -1 dual meaning (black holes/antimatter) is resolved: all-boundary vs boundary-with-interior
- Mass conservation in collapse: |+1-0| = |-1-0|, boundary size determines total mass
- Connects to holographic principle (information lives in boundary structure)
- Antimatter falling into black holes: consistent (both increase boundary mass)

**What remains open:**
- Lorentz invariance must emerge from the pre-geometric base (major challenge, comparable to LQG's continuum limit problem)
- The measure problem may reappear if the structure is infinite
- Gradients need formalization in pre-geometric terms
- The +1 → -1 transition has a sketch (vortex model, critical density trigger) but no derivation
- The function f is unspecified - without it, no predictions follow
- Photons: sketched as "propagating boundary disturbance" but non-annihilation photons, photon properties (frequency, polarization), and vacuum energy remain unexplained

The speculative extension to subatomic physics - mapping antimatter to -1, with annihilation as a +1/-1 transformation - suggests broader explanatory scope. The convergence with Dirac's original "holes" interpretation (1931) is striking: arriving at "antimatter as absence" from completely different reasoning. The ALPHA-g experiment's 2023 confirmation that antimatter falls normally is consistent with (though does not uniquely confirm) the predicted +1/-1 symmetry.

This is currently a conceptual framework, not a predictive model. Formalization would require rigorous definition of the three states as mathematical structures, specification of the recursive function's behavior, derivation of emergent spacetime and matter, and at least one empirical prediction distinguishing it from alternatives.

The core insight: concentrated presence (+1) and concentrated absence (-1) both deviate from neutral (0) in ways creating gravitational effects. This symmetric structure is absent from standard physics.

Whether this becomes a viable research program depends on whether the trinary structure produces genuine predictive constraints. The next step is formalizing the recursive operation and attempting to derive known physics from it.

## Appendix: Key Formulas (Provisional)

**State definition**:
```
S ∈ {-1, 0, +1}
```

**Gravitational effect**:
```
G_eff ∝ |S - 0| = |S|
```
Both +1 and -1 regions curve spacetime.

**Boundary steepness** (discrete):
```
Observable "mass" ∝ |ΔS| across boundary
```
Note: ∇S notation is shorthand; the underlying structure is discrete state differences, not continuous derivatives.

**Time** (informal):
```
t = log(state_transitions)
```
More precisely: ordering from logical dependency chains between states.

**Photon** (sketch, not complete):
```
Photon = propagating boundary disturbance through 0-state regions
```
When +1 + (-1) → 0, gradient energy propagates as pattern through 0. States remain {-1, 0, +1} only; energy is boundary property, not a state. Non-annihilation photons remain unexplained.

**Recursive structure**:
```
Reality = lim_{n→∞} f^n(initial)
Where f: {-1, 0, +1}^k → {-1, 0, +1}^k
```

These are schematic. Formalization requires specifying f, defining adjacency pre-geometrically, and deriving emergent spacetime.
